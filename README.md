Here are my solutions to the "Advent of code" challenge of 2023 implemented mostly in Typescript or Go. See https://adventofcode.com/2023

I am doing this having fun/trying my hand at various Typescript idioms, and start/keep learning Go - not seeking efficiency, scalability nor optimality. But feedback is very welcome.
